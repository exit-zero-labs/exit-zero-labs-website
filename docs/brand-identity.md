# Exit Zero Labs — Brand Identity

## Name

In software, `exit 0` is the exit code for success — the process ran, did its job, and finished clean. Exit Zero Labs builds software that exits clean: no bloat, no fluff, just products that work and matter. "Labs" signals experimentation and craft. We are a workshop, not a factory.

## Mission

Build software that solves real problems for real people — crafted with care, shipped with intention.

## Vision

A world where indie software is taken seriously. Where bootstrapped is a badge of quality, not a limitation.

## Values

- **Craft over speed** — Ship something excellent, not just fast.
- **People over metrics** — Built around humans, not dashboards.
- **Transparency** — Honest about what we are: small team, big ideas.
- **Independence** — Bootstrapped by design, not by accident.

## Taglines

**Primary:** Ship clean. Build forward.

**Alternates:**
- exit 0 — software that works.
- Indie-built. Thoughtfully shipped.
- Software worth using.
- Small team. Real impact.

## Color Palette

| Name | Hex | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| **Zero** | `#0A0F1E` | Primary dark — hero, nav, footer, page background |
| **Dusk** | `#1E293B` | Secondary dark — cards, surfaces, elevated elements |
| **Signal** | `#00D97E` | Primary accent — CTAs, links, highlights, success states |
| **Ember** | `#F97316` | Secondary accent — warmth, community, Kinnections brand |
| **Canvas** | `#FAFAF8` | Light background — manifesto section, light surfaces |
| **Mist** | `#94A3B8` | Muted text — secondary copy, captions, placeholders |

### Product Color Mapping

- **Kinnections** → Ember (`#F97316`) — warmth, human connection
- **Geo Spot** → Signal (`#00D97E`) — exploration, precision, go

### Usage Rules

- **Signal** is for action: buttons, links, interactive highlights. Never use it for large background fills.
- **Ember** is for warmth: product accents, community-related elements. Pair with Zero or Dusk backgrounds.
- **Zero** is the default canvas. The site is dark-first — Zero is the page, not a feature.
- **Canvas** appears only in the manifesto/light sections. It is not "light mode."
- **Mist** is for secondary text only. Never use it for borders or backgrounds.
- **Contrast minimums:** All text on Zero must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1). Signal on Zero = 7.2:1 (passes). Ember on Zero = 4.6:1 (passes). Mist on Zero = 4.1:1 (use at 16px+ only).

## Logo

### Wordmark

**Exit Zero Labs** — "Exit Zero" in Source Serif 4 SemiBold, "Labs" in Source Sans 3 Regular. Always one line. Minimum width: 160px.

### Monogram

**E0L** — the `0` is zero (intentional, brand-meaningful). Set in JetBrains Mono Regular. Used for favicon, social avatars, compact branding.

### Clear Space

### Don'ts

- Don't stretch, rotate, or skew the wordmark.
- Don't change the fonts.

## Brand Voice

### Tone

- **Direct** — Say what you mean. No filler.
- **Crafted** — Word choice matters. Not casual, not corporate.
- **Grounded** — Honest about being indie. No pretense.
- **Human** — We build for people. Sound like one.

### Examples

| Instead of this | Write this |
|-----------------|------------|
| "We're revolutionizing the way people connect." | "Know your people." |
| "Our world-class platform leverages cutting-edge..." | "Built with care. Ships clean." |
| "Join thousands of satisfied users!" | "49 bucks a year. Try it free." |
| "We're excited to announce our latest innovation." | "New thing. It works. Here's what it does." |

### Avoid

Buzzwords: revolutionize, disrupt, world-class, cutting-edge, leverage, synergy.
Hyperbole: "the best," "incredible," "game-changing."
Vague missions: "empowering people to unlock their potential."
Anything that sounds like a Series B announcement.
