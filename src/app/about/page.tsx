          <p className="mt-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-mist">
            Exit Zero Labs was founded on a simple observation: most software is
            built to optimize metrics, not to serve people. Engagement hacking,
            dark patterns, data harvesting — these are symptoms of building for
            investors instead of users.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-mist">
            We wanted to build different. Software that does what it says,
            respects your privacy, and gets out of the way. The kind of tools
            you&apos;d recommend to a friend without caveats.

            This isn&apos;t a pitch. It&apos;s how we operate. Every product

            Why bootstrapped
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-mist">
            Bootstrapping isn&apos;t a constraint — it&apos;s a feature. Without
            venture funding, there&apos;s no pressure to hyper-grow, no
            incentive to monetize attention, and no board meetings where someone
            asks about monthly active users.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-mist">
            The business model is simple: build something good enough that
            people pay for it. If the product doesn&apos;t earn its keep, we
            make it better. That alignment between revenue and quality is the
            whole point.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-mist">
            Ship clean. Build forward. Exit zero.
